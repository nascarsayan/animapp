# Tab Tracker
A Vue.js / Express.js web application for keeping journals of anime

# Setup

You need to have Node Js installed: https://nodejs.org/en/

You must at least have **NODE version 8.2.1**

Don't know how to install different version of node?  Try this: https://github.com/tj/n

I suggest you install the following that I use in the video:

VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/

Tmux: https://github.com/tmux/tmux/
`sudo apt install tmux`

Git: https://git-scm.com/

### Client - Terminal A
```
cd client
yarn
yarn run start
```

### Server - Terminal B
```
cd server
yarn
yarn run start
```
